<h1>STATS UPDATE Extension Command</h1>

<p>Update the active data file from a secondary or transaction
file</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p>STATS UPDATE<br/>
UPDATESOURCE = "sav file" or "update dataset name"<sup>&#42;</sup><br/>
IDVARS = id variable name(s)<sup>&#42;</sup><br/>
SOURCEIND = name for variable to record case source<br/>
MAP = NO<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> or YES</p>

<p>/HELP</p>

<p><sup>&#42;</sup> Required<br/>
<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> Default</p>
</div>

<p>STATS UPDATE /HELP.  prints this information and does nothing else.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>
STATS UPDATE UPDATESOURCE="c:/data/updates.sav"
IDVARS=id SOURCEIND=FROM MAP=YES.
</code></pre>

<p>This procedure copies data from the update dataset or file
  to the active file, replacing existing values of matching cases in the active file except that missing or blank values are not copied.  
  The variable types of the updating and updated variables must agree.
  Cases in the two files are matched according to a set
  of one or more id variables.  </p>
  
  <p>This procedure differs from Merge Files
  Add Cases or Add Variables in that the update file values replace
  the active file variables.  This is particularly useful when the
  update file holds a set of transactions.  Variables not already
  present in the active file are added to it.  Further details
  are provided in the Command Syntax Reference under the UPDATE command.</p>
  

<p><strong>UPDATESOURCE</strong> specifies the quoted name of a sav file
or dataset containing the values to update.</p>
<p><strong>SOURCEIND</strong> specifies a name for a new variable 
  that will indicate the source of each case in the updated active file.  Its value is 1 for the active file and 0 for the update file.<p>
<p><strong>MAP</strong> specifies whether to produce a list of the 
  variables in the new active dataset and the file from which they came or not.
Variables are listed in the order in which they appear in the resulting file.</p>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
Using the UPDATE command instead of this procedure, you can specify which variables in the update file
are copied; you can rename variables, and you can have more than one update file.  The purpose of STATS UPDATE and its dialog box
is just to make it easier to use the UPDATE command, which does not itself have
a dialog box interface.</p>
